Who, What, Where, Why? 

Matthew Gingell, <gingell@adacore.com>. June 2009.

* Chesley the Chess Engine! is a computer chess program for Unix-like
  targets written in C++. Chesley is compatible with the xboard GUI.

* Chesley takes its name from Chesley B. "Sully" Sullenberger, the
  pilot who successfully landed a airplane on the Hudson river around
  the time I was getting started.

* To install, see the Makefile in this directory. Chesley will perform
  much better if your compiler and target support 64-bit mode. If
  possible, the engine should be compiled with -m64. However if that
  doesn't work you will need to remove that flag.

* If you're interested in Chesley please take a look at my blog at:
  http://chesley.sourceforge.net. The engine is under very active
  development, and from the SourceForge site you can track the latest
  changes and download the very latest sources.

* I'd love to hear from anyone with comments, so please feel free to
  send me some mail at gingell@adacore.com.
