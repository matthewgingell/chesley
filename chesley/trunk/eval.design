  * Reward knight outposts:
     
    An outpost is a square which a knight can occupy , which is either
    immune from attack (like d5 in the lower diagram) or the opponent
    would get into other sorts of trouble by getting rid of it (like
    in the Tal game overleaf). So, one of the key strategical ideas in
    chess is the knight outpost.
