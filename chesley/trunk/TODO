  * 8/k7/3p4/p2P1p2/P2P1P2/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1: best move is Ka1b1. Must
    search to ply 20, which is nearly free with correct trans
    tables. Check it in testsuite.

  * Convert ostring functions to to_string functions.

  * Hunt for things that can be made const.

  * Collect and analyize search statistics.

  * Use readline and completions.

  * Add help command.

Interface:

  * Get zippy working.
  * Do validity checking.

Clean up:

  * Move util stuff to a .cpp?

  * We use a weird mix of C++ string and C char *, and C++ iostreams
    and C FILE *. Each of these has real advantages in th appropriate
    setting, but we really ought to be able to normalize our usage
    somewhat.

Testing:

  * Add log and debugging infrastructure.

Search

  * Time management 

Eval

  * Reward good pawn structure.
  * Do some research....
