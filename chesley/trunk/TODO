Bugs:

Next items:

  * Implement zobrost hashing.

  * Cleanup junky initialize code now we understand C++ global
    initialization,
     
  * Don't put so much junk in Move.    

  * Must have a good way of measuring search correctness, strength,
    and speed before we try to improved them.

Interface:

  * Finish and clean up implementation of Xboard protocol.
  * Do validity checking.

Clean up:

  * Move util stuff to a .cpp?

  * We use a weird mix of C++ string and C char *, and C++ iostreams
    and C FILE *. Each of these has real advantages in th appropriate
    setting, but we really ought to be able to normalize our usage
    somewhat.

Testing:

  * Add log and debugging infrastructure.
  * Setup automated regression testing.

Move generation:

  * Should be possible to write a much faster check tester.

Session

  * Implement Xboard protocol.

Search

  * Implement 3 fold repetition detection. Right now Chesley plays and
    incredibly irritating end game, repeatedly running the half move
    clock up to 49 then moving a pawn...
  * Quiescence search
  * Must do timed searches, and do some kind of overall time
    management for timed games.
  * Iterative deepening.
  X Heuristic move ordering.
  * Aspiration windows
  * Transposition tables.
  * Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE) for capture ordering.
  * Null move heuristic

  ??? MTD(f)

Eval

  * Reward good pawn structure.
  * Do some research....
