Bugs:

Interface:

  * Finish and clean up implementation of Xboard protocol.
  * Do validity checking.
  * Terminate xboard games in a reasonable way.
  * Do end game reporting.


Clean up:

  * Move util stuff to a .cpp?

  * We use a weird mix of C++ string and C char *, and C++ iostreams
    and C FILE *. Each of these has real advantages in th appropriate
    setting, but we really ought to be able to normalize our usage.

Testing:

  * Add log and debugging infrastructure.
  * Setup automated regression testing.
  * Test perft in middle and end game.

Move generation:

  * Should be possible to write a much faster check tester.

Session

  * Implement command interpreter.
  * Implement Xboard protocol.
  * Implement Universal Chess Interface (UCI)

Search

  * Implement 3 fold repetition detection. Right now Chesley plays and
    incredibly irritating end game, repeatedly running the half move
    clock up to 50 then moving a pawn...
  * Quiescence search
  * Must do timed searches, and do some kind of overall time
    management for timed games.
  * Iterative deepening.
  X Heuristic move ordering.
  * Aspiration windows
  * Transposition tables.
  * Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE) for capture ordering.

  ??? Negascout
  ??? MTD(f)

Eval

  * Reward good pawn structure.
  * Do some research....
