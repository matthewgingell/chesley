*  Goal is to be as simple and as well commented as possible. Logic and
   terminology must be cleat to a reader unfamiliar with the
   sources. We would *much* rather over comment than under comment.

*  Should provide references to write-ups of algorithms whenever
   possible.

*  Always include variable names in prototypes.

*  Use C style comment box for major headings, eg:

  /**************************************************/
  /* Compute legal destinations for ordinary moves. */
  /**************************************************/

* Use C++ style comments for minor headings, eg:

  // Collect each destination in the moves list.
  while (to)
  {
    out.push (Move (KING, from, bit_idx (to), flags.to_move));
    to = clear_lsb (to);
  }

* Major headings should precead each logically seperate task in a
  subprogram.

* One blank line after major headings.

* Never put "using namespace" directives in header files.
